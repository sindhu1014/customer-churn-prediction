# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in a telecom company. It applies classification models to identify high-risk customers and generate actionable insights for retention.

## 🔍 Objective
To help telecom providers reduce customer churn by analyzing behavioral and demographic data, and identifying key churn indicators.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer demographics and services
- Classification using Gradient Boosting (top-performing model)
- Model comparison with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- SHAP values for model interpretability
- Business recommendations to reduce churn risk

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint for presentation

## 📁 File Structure
- `notebook/Customer_Churn_Prediction-Telecom.ipynb`: Full ML pipeline notebook
- `presentation/Customer_Churn_Prediction_Presentation.pptx`: Project summary deck

## 📊 Results
- Gradient Boosting achieved 89% test accuracy
- Key churn drivers: Contract type (month-to-month), senior citizen status, and fiber optic service usage
- Recommended targeting senior users and re-evaluating pricing for fiber users

## 🚀 Future Work
- Include more features like customer support calls or billing issues
- Explore ensemble methods for higher predictive performance
- Integrate dashboards for live churn monitoring
